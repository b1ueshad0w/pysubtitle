# PySubtitle
A simple yet useful python script to adjust the subtitle file to 
get synchronous with the movie by increasing/decresing the subtitle's delay.

# Usage
Increase delay with 5 seconds:
```
python pysubtitle.py -i subtitle_file -o new_subtitle_file -s 5
```
Decrease delay with 5 seconds:
```
python pysubtitle.py -i subtitle_file -o new_subtitle_file -s 5 -d
```

Use python pysubtitle.py -h to show detailed manual.
Feel free to modify the script to suit your need ^_^.
